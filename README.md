<h1>Introduction ðŸ“”</h1>

Medscrape is used to irradicate common medication mistakes people do and not adhering to the 
medication,People usually consume medicines that is not to be consumed for the symptoms they are facing 
which may lead to serious health problems and even cost his/her life.

It also tells the patient/user when and in case of what symptoms they should
consume the medicine they want to know about.

It can also be used by people who tend to forget about the medicine they
have to consume and thus can use our website to upload the image of the medicine
that they dont know about it and get the correct information regarding it.

Our project helps in classification of the medicine image that user wants to know
about and return him/her the name of the medicine detected and provide the required
information about the medicine which is medicine name,introduction,side effect and
when to consume.

The image classification is done using Transfer Learning model InceptionV3 which 
processes the medicine image given by the patient/user on our website and provides the user with
the correct information which is rendered on the web page.
